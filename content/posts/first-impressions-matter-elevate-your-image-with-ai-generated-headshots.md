In a world that is more connected and visual than ever, your online presence speaks volumes before you even say a word. **Whether you’re applying for a job, networking on LinkedIn, or simply introducing yourself on social media, the image you present is often the first impression you make.** And as the saying goes, "You never get a second chance to make a first impression."
