# From Concept to Creation — The Process of AI-Generated Fashion

Creating a couture masterpiece used to mean weeks of sketching, fittings, and fabric trials. But in the age of AI, fashion is no longer just handcrafted — it's co-created with code.

With the **Met Gala AI Generator**, users can turn a simple selfie and a fashion idea into a red carpet-ready editorial portrait in under a minute. But how exactly does that process work?

Let’s break down the steps — from initial vision to final download.

## 🧠 Step 1: Ideation — Crafting the Concept

Like any fashion project, it begins with a creative direction. Do you want something regal? Futuristic? Sculptural? Minimalist?  
This “mood” becomes your prompt foundation — which informs the aesthetic direction of the AI-generated look.

**🧾 Prompt:**  
> “A Met Gala look inspired by futuristic royalty, silver-gold palette, flowing metallic fabrics, asymmetrical silhouette, luxury red carpet setting”

---

## 🖼 Step 2: Building the Model

You upload **15–20 high-quality selfies** that represent your face clearly, in different lighting and angles. These are used to train your **private AI model** — ensuring that every fashion output is built around your actual likeness.

Once trained, your **AI couture avatar** becomes the canvas for every fashion-forward transformation.

## 🎛 Step 3: Styling the Scene

You select the **Met Gala AI preset**, which comes with built-in configurations:

- Red carpet backdrops  
- Luxury lighting setups  
- High-fashion poses  
- Editorial framing  

You can also tweak the prompt manually to define color, cut, mood, lighting, and more — just like giving instructions to a stylist and a lighting crew in one go.

**🧾 Prompt (custom version):**  
> “A female celebrity at the Met Gala wearing an emerald green sculptural gown with asymmetric neckline, spotlight-focused lighting, surrounded by paparazzi flashes, editorial style portrait”

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Generation

You hit **Generate**, and in under 30 seconds, your portrait appears: a **high-resolution, AI-generated Met Gala fashion image** — seamlessly blending realism and fantasy.

The result feels like something out of *Vogue* or *Vanity Fair* — and it’s tailored around **you**.

**🧾 Prompt:**  
> “A high-fashion Met Gala portrait with metallic gown, soft rim lighting, velvet ropes in background, composed expression, high-res editorial finish”

---

## 💾 Step 5: Download and Share

Your AI red carpet portrait is ready to **download, post, or add to your portfolio**. Many users use their images for:

- Instagram highlights  
- Digital portfolios  
- Storytelling or moodboards  
- Fashion-themed avatar content  

With tools like this, AI fashion design becomes not only possible — but expressive, personal, and share-worthy.
