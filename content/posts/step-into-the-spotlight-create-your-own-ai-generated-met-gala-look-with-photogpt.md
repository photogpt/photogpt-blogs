# How to Create Your Own AI-Generated Met Gala Look

The Met Gala is where art, fashion, and fantasy collide — a night known for pushing boundaries and spotlighting creativity. But what if you didn’t need a personal invite or a designer label to walk the carpet?

Thanks to **PhotoGPT AI’s Met Gala preset**, anyone can step into the spotlight with a couture-inspired, red carpet-ready portrait powered by artificial intelligence.

In this blog, we’ll guide you through how to create your own AI-generated Met Gala look in just a few easy steps.

## 🎯 Step 1: Train Your AI Model

Upload **15–20 well-lit selfies** of yourself — these should include a variety of expressions and angles (front-facing, slight turns, neutral backgrounds). This forms the foundation for your **personal AI model** — a digital version of you that’s used to generate glamorous, editorial-style portraits.



---

## ✨ Step 2: Choose the Met Gala Preset

Once your AI model is trained, head to the **“Met Gala” preset** in the interface.  
This preset is tailored to give your portraits:

- A grand staircase or red carpet setting  
- Flashing paparazzi lights and velvet ropes  
- Fashion-forward styling cues (structured gowns, bold tuxedos)  
- Dramatic lighting in the style of a *Vogue* editorial shoot  

No complex prompts needed — the default setup already brings the glamour.

## 🧥 Step 3: Customize Your Look

Want to embody **“futuristic royalty”?** Or maybe channel **golden-age glamour with a modern twist**?  
You can optionally edit the default prompt to specify:

- **Color tones** (deep gold, icy silver, blood red, etc.)  
- **Materials** (metallics, feathers, sheer panels, etc.)  
- **Aesthetic themes** (surreal, elegant, space-age, vintage)  
- **Lighting moods and background intensity** to match your vibe



---

## 📸 Step 4: Generate & Download

Once you’re happy with the settings, click **Generate**.  
Your AI-generated portraits will appear within seconds — **high-res, hyper-stylized, and ready for the runway**.

You can save them instantly and upload to Instagram, Threads, or your portfolio.
