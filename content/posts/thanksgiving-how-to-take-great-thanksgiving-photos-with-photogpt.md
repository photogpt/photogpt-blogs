# **Plan Your Thanksgiving Look with PhotoGPT**

In this first episode of the "How to Take Great Thanksgiving Photos" series, we’ll focus on planning and styling your Thanksgiving photos. With PhotoGPT, you can coordinate outfits, test color schemes, and prepare your holiday look ahead of time. This will ensure you’re ready for picture-perfect Thanksgiving moments!

## **1. Plan Your Outfits with PhotoGPT for a Coordinated Look**

One of the easiest ways to make your Thanksgiving photos look polished is by coordinating family outfits. Colours like deep reds, forest greens, mustard yellows, and burnt oranges are perfect for Thanksgiving and will add a festive touch to your photos. With PhotoGPT, you can try out different outfit ideas and colour schemes ahead of time.

**How to Use PhotoGPT:** Use the Create Models feature to upload photos of yourself or family members. Then, use Generate Images to see how different outfit colours look together. This will help you find a colour scheme that makes everyone look their best without being too “matchy.”

## **2. Experiment with Thanksgiving-Themed Colors and Accessories**

Thanksgiving colours like burnt orange, deep red, and earthy brown are classic for a reason. These colours not only reflect the season but also photograph beautifully. With PhotoGPT, you can try out these colours virtually to see which shades suit you and your family best.

**How to Use PhotoGPT:** Create a model of yourself in PhotoGPT and use the Generate Images feature to visualise how different Thanksgiving colours look on you. Experiment with adding accessories like scarves, hats, or jewellery to complete the look.

**Tip:** Choose a cohesive colour palette and keep each family member’s outfit within that theme. PhotoGPT can help you visualise different combinations until you find the perfect look.

Stay tuned for Episode 2, where we’ll dive into capturing candid moments and perfecting the lighting in your Thanksgiving photos!
