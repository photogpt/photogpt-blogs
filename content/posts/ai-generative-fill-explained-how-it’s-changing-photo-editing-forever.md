Now, AI has rewritten the rules with something called **generative fill**. Instead of hours of technical work, you can simply select an area of a photo and type a prompt like *‚Äúreplace the sky with a sunset‚Äù* or *‚Äúadd a chair in the corner‚Äù,* and the AI handles the rest.  

In this guide, we‚Äôll explain **what generative fill is**, how it works, and why tools like **[PhotoGPT‚Äôs AI generative fill](https://www.photogptai.com/dashboard/image-editing)** are transforming photo editing forever.

## What is Generative Fill?

**Generative fill** is an AI-powered feature that allows you to **add, remove, or extend parts of an image automatically**.  

It works by analyzing the photo, understanding lighting, perspective, and textures, and then generating new pixels that seamlessly blend into the scene.  

You can use it to:  

* **Add objects to a photo with AI** (e.g., ‚Äúplace a coffee mug on the table‚Äù).  
* **Remove unwanted elements** (like strangers or clutter).  
* **Extend the background with AI** (known as *outpainting*).  
* **Replace backgrounds** entirely.

## How Generative Fill Works (In Simple Terms)

Behind the scenes, generative fill uses **diffusion models** - the same type of AI powering image generators like Stable Diffusion or DALL¬∑E.  

Here‚Äôs the simple workflow:  

1. **You select a part of the photo.**  
2. **You give the AI a prompt (or leave it blank).**  

   * Blank = AI fills naturally (e.g., extend the sky).  
   * Prompt = AI generates custom content (e.g., ‚Äúreplace the sky with northern lights‚Äù).  
3. **The AI analyzes context.**  

   * Lighting, depth, colors, and textures.  
4. **It generates new pixels.**  

   * Seamlessly blending with the original photo.  

This is why generative fill looks more natural than simple ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù cloning.
